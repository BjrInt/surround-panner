# Surround Panner

## What is a surround panner

A surround panner is like a magical tool for sound that helps us feel immersed in movies, music, or games. Imagine you're in the center of a circle, and there are speakers placed around you. Each speaker plays a different sound, creating a 3D audio experience. A surround panner allows sound experts to control where these sounds come fromâ€”whether it's behind, in front, or beside you. By adjusting the panner, they can make a sound, like footsteps or a car honk, seem as if it's coming from a specific direction. It's what makes a movie scene with birds chirping in the background or a race car zooming by feel incredibly real, enhancing our overall audio experience in a way that makes us feel like we're part of the action.

## Notes / To Do

- Add volumes computation
- This should work on mobile phone, but it wasn't battle-tested.
- The subwoofer volume is not included.
- The "room" is a circle of diameter 2 (without any units). (TODO: Add room measurements)

## Build and run locally

Same, as usual :

```
# install dependencies
npm i

# run the project
npm run dev
```
